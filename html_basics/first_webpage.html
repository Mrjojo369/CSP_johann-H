    <h3>Other bikes from honda</h3>
        <p>
            Aside from the simple trail bikes honda makes bikes that are made for competative motocross otherwise known as race built bikes! Such as the CRF250R Which comes race built from the factory. It is similar to the 250f except it has more power and better suspention and overall better specs than that of the 250f, it has a higher top speed as well and is more mobile for sharp track turns! The 250f is more begginer oriented while the 250r is reccomendod for those with more experience. Honda also offers a wide range of other sized engines as well from thier 450x all the way to their crf50 wich is a good begginer bike for small childern. the crf50 has an automatic clutch so that your children can focus on learning how to handle a bike and then they can move up to the crf110f which has a fuel injected engine and is low seated perfect for kids too big for the crf50f but still to small for a 125 two stroke!
