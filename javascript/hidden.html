            <h1> the best game ever, fortnite</h1>
            <p >There is quite a fun game known as fortnite. It has a large player base and is mostly liked by young kids known as "sweats" </p>
            <p>A sweat is someone who never gets off the game and has no life. They are way to good at the game so their friends, if they even have any do not like playing the game with them. No one likes sweats.</p>
