        <p>I will vbe reviewing one of my favorite classes compter science principals. I really like this class especially when i understand it and what is happenning in the class. when i understand what is happening it is easy and i really enjoy working. Some units like the coding one were hard for me to understand so i was behind a lot, but i really like this html unit becuse it makes sense to me!</p>
